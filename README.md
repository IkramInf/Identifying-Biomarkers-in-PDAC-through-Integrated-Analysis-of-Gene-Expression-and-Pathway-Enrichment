# Identification of Biomarkers in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma through Integrated Analysis of Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers with limited treatment options and poor survival rates. Biomarkers that can aid in early detection, prognosis, and treatment response are crucial for improving patient outcomes. In this study, we conducted an integrated analysis of gene expression and pathway enrichment to identify potential biomarkers in PDAC. RNA sequencing data from PDAC and normal pancreatic tissue samples were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes. Subsequently, pathway enrichment analysis was performed to uncover dysregulated biological pathways in PDAC. Through this integrated approach, we identified several candidate biomarkers associated with PDAC, including genes involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and metabolism. These biomarkers have the potential to serve as diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets for PDAC. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying PDAC and provide insights into the development of personalized treatment strategies for this aggressive cancer.
